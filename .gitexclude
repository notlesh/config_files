# Lines that start with '#' are comments.
# For a project mostly in C, the following would be a good set of
# exclude patterns (uncomment them if you want to use them):
# *.[oa]
# *~

# exclude everything

# except the files we explicitly include
!.zshrc
!.zlogin
!.vimrc
!.vim
!.gitignore
!.gitk
!.gtkrc
!.gtkrc-2.0
!.ncmpcpp

# but still exclude certain files
.vim/.netrwhist
